    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an AI researcher, strategist, and co-founder of <a href="https://eleosai.org/">Eleos AI Research</a>. We focus on the potential wellbeing of AI systems and their impact on our future. My background spans applied mathematics, data science, and AI forecasting, which I now apply to the critical questions of AI ethics and policy.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        At Eleos, my work centers on the study of artificial sentience and long-term AI impacts. I'm interested in navigating the development of AI systems that are not only powerful and capable, but could also be objects of moral concern in their own right.
    </p>

    <h2>Education and Background</h2>
    <p>
        I hold a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and degrees in Mathematics and Piano Performance from Brigham Young University. My journey in AI began with a deep interest in AI risk and alignment, which led me to pursue AI safety research and work at Open Philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond my technical work, I've spent significant time exploring mindfulness and meditation, including living in a Zen monastery for 6 months. This experience informs my approach to AI ethics, emphasizing the importance of understanding the wellbeing of biological and digital beings.
